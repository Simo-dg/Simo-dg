# 💫 Simone - Data Science & ML

[cite_start]🔭 I'm an MSc student in Economic and Social Sciences at Bocconi University[cite: 5, 7], focusing on applying machine learning to complex economic and business challenges.

[cite_start]🌱 I'm currently a Research Assistant at Bocconi [cite: 36][cite_start], where I'm building a 2TB financial dataset for market microstructure research[cite: 39].

[cite_start]⚡ Previously, I was a Finance Analyst Intern at Amazon (Amazon Air EU), where I built automated ETL pipelines and analytics tools to save over 10 hours of manual work per week[cite: 30, 31, 33].

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I've built.

### 1. ✈️ Aircraft Delay Log Intelligence (NLP)
* [cite_start]Developed an end-to-end NLP pipeline to classify aircraft delay causes, operational phases, and predictability from free-text incident reports[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]Fine-tuned BERT models achieved a **1.00 F1-score** (delay type) and **0.71 F1-score** (phase)[cite: 46].
* [cite_start]Integrated attention-based interpretability for token attribution and deployed the model as a Streamlit app[cite: 47].
* **[Tech:]** Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face (BERT), Streamlit

### 2. 📦 Automated Pallet Counting (Computer Vision)
* [cite_start]Developed a multi-target regression system to count 'chep', 'epal', and 'total' pallets from warehouse images[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]Built and tested an ensemble of **EfficientNet-B3, ResNet-50, and ConvNeXt-Tiny**, achieving an **MAE of 1.15** and **R² of 0.95**[cite: 43, 44].
* [cite_start]Used Grad-CAM for model explainability and extensive data augmentation for generalization[cite: 44].
* **[Tech:]** Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Grad-CAM

### 3. 📈 Inflation Forecasting in Crisis Times
* [cite_start]Built and evaluated 9 forecasting models, including MLPs, ensemble methods, and Bayesian Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs)[cite: 40].
* [cite_start]Implemented Sequential Monte Carlo, MCMC sampling, and regime-switching dynamics[cite: 41].
* [cite_start]Neural networks achieved a **6.8% RMSE improvement** over benchmarks, while Bayesian methods provided superior uncertainty quantification[cite: 42].
* **[Tech:]** Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Bayesian Modeling, R
